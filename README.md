All UML related stuff is in "UML Diagrams" directory.

The skeleton implementation of parsing and drawing is in /src/skeleton.

I still kept the implemented classes from the first hand-in, in /src/hadin1, for convenience.

If there are any parts in the UML diagrams that have "drawing." before a class/interface/method name,
this is because they were automatically changed by the IDE.
I tried to change them back, but it is possible I missed one by accident.
