The location selection is fully functional (I hope), although it is not completely
polished yet. I will make it look better over the next week. Same goes for the map itsel.

Some methods of working classes (those in packages "parsing" and "drawing" are not implemented
yet. Because I work better when I actually start to implement things, rather than plan them
out in diagrams, the result is redundant, and sometimes lacking methods.

I have left the main frame description and use cases from handin 2 for your convenience.

The MapFrame class, which is the top level class, does not have some UI components fully
implemented yet. This is because they were not required to do the things specified in this
handin. I am planning to implement and polish them up over the upcoming break and periodically
push them to my Git server.

Some details (minor in my opinion) were left out of the sequence diagrams. I did this to prevent from making
them ridiculously long. As you will find out, the "Driving There" sequence diagram is already long as it is.
Hopefully it will take you less time to read it than it took me to make it. I apologize about that in advance.
