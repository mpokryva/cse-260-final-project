# CSE 260 Final Project

This is my final project for CSE 260 (Data Structures). 

It is a Java application which parses an OSM file, and draws the corresponding map, 
with abilities to find the shortest path between two points, using Dijkstra's Algorithm. 

The "GPSDeivce.jar" library 
included in the project is used to show the ability of the app to provide "off-course" directions. Just try it!

## Some user instructions: 

Select locations: Right-click, choose option.

Activate "drive-there mode": Select ending location. press "Drive."

Note: File selection opens an extra window. I as not sure how to close previous window. Try using feature at your own risk.
