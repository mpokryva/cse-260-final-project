I implemented zoom, pan, and resizing.
I tried to make zoom and pan work similar to the way they work in Google Maps.

For parsing the data, I created classes for different XML elements (when necessary).
I then used the OSMParser class to parse the elements, with the help of the OSMElementHandler class, 
which converted the Strings generated by OSMParser into useful objects. 

OSMElement is the superclass of all other elements such as Tag, Node, Way, etc.

It's worth mentioning I could have implemented the above much more optimally, and I am planning to 
work on that in later handins. 

The MapDisplay class is the class where all GUI stuff occurs (drawing the map, zooming, panning, etc.)
